# To set up using locally hosted IIS with a different URL

1. Created new IIS site using www.owin.demo for the C:\dev\Repos\Owin\Owin.Demo directory (run inetmgr)
2. Modified C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts to have localhost be www.owin.demo
3. Modified properties of project in VS to use Local IIS and point to http://www.owin.demo

# Adding Facebook login

1. Go to http://developers.facebook.com and create new app id
2. Once setup go to Settings->Advanced
2a. Find "Valid OAuth redirect URIs"
2b. Add "http://www.owin.demo/signin-facebook" as the URI

3. Add from NuGet: microsoft.owin.security.facebook
3a. Note that the "signin-facebook" is configurable in the middleware we are going to use but it is fine.

4. Copy App ID and AppSecret from the Basic tab and paste into the following section in Startup.cs

	app.UseFacebookAuthentication(new FacebookAuthenticationOptions
	{
		AppId = "",
		AppSecret = "",
		SignInAsAuthenticationType = "ApplicationCookie"
	});
